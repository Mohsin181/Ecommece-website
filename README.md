 Hackathon Day 1: Building the Foundation for a Marketplace!

Today, I had the amazing opportunity to dive into the essentials of e-commerce platform as part of my hackathon task. 
We explored various types of marketplaces like E-commerce, Rental Commerce, and Q Commerce, gaining insights into their unique dynamics. After careful consideration, I chose to work on a Traditional E-commerce Platform.
 Key Features of My Platform:
1. Delivering high-quality products with transparency.
2. No hidden charges – ensuring complete trust for customers.
3. On-time delivery to provide a seamless shopping experience.
 Solving Customer Problems:
Offering reliable services.
Simplifying the shopping process.
Ensuring affordability without compromising on quality.
 To top it all off, I designed a project schema to visualize my platform's workflow and structure. This helped me solidify my ideas and create a strong foundation for the upcoming steps in the hackathon.
Excited to see where this journey takes me! Stay tuned for more updates.
